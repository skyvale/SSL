### Assignment #1 | Grader
This assignment goes over the basics of Ruby, Python, and Nodejs. Including: classes, functions, getting user input, and storing/manipulating variables.

### Assignment #2 | Web Server
Using what we learned about Nodejs, we set up a server and created a small generic application using Nodejs and Bootstrap.

### Assignment #3 | Validation
Using Express, BodyParser, and Nodemon, we created a login form and validated it all using server-side code.

### Assignment #4 | Async/Sync
For this assignment, we were given an async function full of errors and had to correct them so it would work properly.
